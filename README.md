# Sports Tournament Management System (STMS)

**BİL372 - Database Project**

An international sports tournament host needs a reliable system to organize and hold records of its tournaments, participating teams, players, scores and related player and team information. The proposed project aims to solve this problem.

The Sports Tournament Management System (STMS) helps the above-mentioned organizer to manage every part of a tournament, covering a range of sports. It organizes sports, tournaments (each of a type of sport), tournament locations, teams, matches, players, player stats (per match), referees of each match. 

A feature that makes the STMS unique is the usage of JSON for storing each sport rules. The JSON file that will be stored in the Sports table will hold rules for each sport. This makes it easy to adjust or add rules without having to redesign the database. STMS allows adding, updating, or removing records, viewing specific player performances at a match, pulling up player stats and match results, managing tournament schedules, and keeping team rosters organized.
 
Overall, the proposed STMS database aims to solve the problems sport tournament hosts may face.
